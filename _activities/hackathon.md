![ML4SCI Logo](ML4SCI.jpg)

We are pleased to announce the **Machine Learning for Science (ML4SCI) Hackathon Competition** that will take place virtually from **October 26-30, 2020**. The competition is sponsored by the University of Alabama Cyber Initiative and the Brown Data Science Initiative and is open to anyone interested. The hackathon will focus on applying **machine learning** techniques to scientific challenges, including those from the fields of physics, astronomy, planetary science and geoscience.

The agenda for the hackathon can be found here: https://indico.cern.ch/event/966872/ 

Anyone interested in learning more about machine learning techniques and trying their hand at the competition is welcome. The **kickoff Zoom meeting** is on **Monday, 26 October at 4 PM US Central Time (5PM EDT)**. There will also be an introductory machine learning lecture by Prof. Harrison Prosper (FSU) on Tuesday, 27 October at 1:30 PM Central.

Interested participants can register via Slack at https://bit.ly/3noij1V. 

There are six main challenges:

* Higgs Boson Challenge (Classification, General)

* Particle Images Challenge (Classification, Computer Vision)

* Strong Lensing Challenge (Anomaly Detection)

* NMR Spin Challenge (Multi-Target Regression)

* Cosmic Rays in Planetary Science Images (Image Segmentation)

* Google Earth Engine Challenge (Anomaly Detection)

Please find more details and example Jupyter notebooks inside each challenge folder.

Solutions are due on Friday, Oct 30 at 7pm EDT/6pm Central time. Winners will receive certificates and prizes. For any questions about the ML4SCI Hackathon please contact Prof. Sergei Gleyzer [sgleyzer@ua.edu](mailto:sgleyzer@ua.edu)




















## Introduction

In 2021 ML4SCI is participating in the program as a GSoC umbrella organization.
The ML4SCI organization has partnered with the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) in 2021 to broaden student participation in machine learning projects over a wide variety of scientific fields.
ML4SCI participants will be mentored by scientists at top research universities and laboratories on research projects at the cutting edge of science.
Projects span a wide range of scientific domains, including physics, astronomy, planetary science, quantum information science and others.



### For Students


In 2021 GSoC students work with their mentors for 175 hrs to produce open-source codes that apply machine learning solutions to solve science problems. Projects span three evaluation periods that allow for students and mentors to collaborate on their project and evaluate student progress. Detailed rules for the GSOC program can be found [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules/).
Interested students should look at the ideas page and contact the mentors. Candidates will be asked to complete an evaluation test for each project they apply to demonstrate the skills needed for the respective projects. In the next step, students will produce a proposal which will be evaluated for final student selection.  
The detailed timeline is shown below.
