# ![ML4SCI](/images/CERN-HSF-GSoC-logo.png){:height="100px"} Google Summer of Code 2021

## Introduction

In 2021 ML4SCI is participating in the program as a GSoC umbrella organization.
The ML4SCI organization has partnered with the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) in 2021 to broaden student participation in machine learning projects over a wide variety of scientific fields.
ML4SCI participants will be mentored by scientists at top research universities and laboratories on research projects at the cutting edge of science.
Projects span a wide range of scientific domains, including physics, astronomy, planetary science, quantum information science and others.



### For Students

If you are interested in the ML4SCI projects, please start by having a look at our [guidelines for students](/gsoc/students-guideline.html).

Projects for ML4SCI GSoC in 2021 will be published by **February 19**. The student application period will begin on **March 29**, but discussions about student project ideas with mentors will take place starting on **March 9**, when the list of accepted Organizations is announced. You are encouraged to monitor this website in order to get acquainted with our projects and be prepared for contacting their mentors.

Please avoid having the first contact with the mentors of ML4SCI projects before **March 9** or after **March 20**! You are encouraged to take the time to read our project proposals until **March 9**, focusing on only one or two projects that attract your interest. Once you have identified those, you should e-mail the respective mentors, attaching your CV and describing the motivation for your choice. The mentors will first propose an evaluation test, waiting for your solution. Note that the test you are given is private, your solution should be personal and the response time is part of the evaluation. Mentors will let you know the test results, and if you passed they will start discussing and helping you develop a project idea. The student application period is **March 29 - April 13**, when you will have to write and review your proposal with help from your mentors.

For further information, feel free to contact the ML4SCI GSoC admins.

### For Projects and Mentors

Instructions for participating projects and mentors can be found [here](/gsoc/guideline.html). The main differences compared to last year are that proposals have to be tuned for 175-hour project length, and the target objectives must be well-defined deliverables.

We have a mentor-only Google group where we handle all announcements related to GSoC for our ML4SCI Umbrella Organization. Please write us a mail to [???@googlegroups.com](mailto:???@googlegroups.com) if you want to add your preferred email to this list. Note that all participating mentors in 2021 ML4SCI GSoC will have to be added to this group. Please let us know if for some reason your want your mail removed from this list.

For new groups wishing to join ML4SCI GSoC umbrella rather than being independent organizations: there is no formal procedure, you will just need to add a description and logo for your organization. Note that your project needs to have some connection with Machine Learning applied to Science to join us. We need one contact person for each new group, so please write us an e-mail.
