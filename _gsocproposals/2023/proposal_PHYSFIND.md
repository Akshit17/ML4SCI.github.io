## Description

Understanding planet formation is key to unlocking Earth's and the Solar System's history as well as the possibility and abundance of life in the universe. Using observational and simulated data, the student will train machine learning models that can detect the presence of a particular physical process in planet-forming environments. The student will apply their models to data from real observations with the hopes of finding previously overlooked phenomena in order to further inform the scientific community of relevant, observable phenomena involved in planet formation.

## Duration

Total project length: 175 hours

## Task Ideas

* Simulate planet-forming environments under a variety of physical conditions
* Generate synthetic observations using those simulations that will be used as the input to the models
* Apply models to previously analyzed systems in order to confirm reality of the models
* Apply to new observations

## Expected Results

* Novel simulational data and trained models

## Requirements

* Python, PyTorch, C/Fortran
* Background in astronomy is a bonus but not a requirement

## Mentors

* [Sergei Gleyzer](http://sergeigleyzer.com/) (University of Alabama)

Please DO NOT contact mentors directly by email, and instead please send project inquiries to [ml4-sci@cern.ch](mailto:ml4-sci@cern.ch) with Project Title in the subject and relevant mentors will get in touch with you.
