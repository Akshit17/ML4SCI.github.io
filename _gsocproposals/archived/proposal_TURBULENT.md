## Description
One of the most important outstanding questions in fluid dynamics is the study of how and why uniform flow transitions to chaotic motion, or turbulence. Turbulent flow is a vital aspect in the design of airplanes, cars, and boats, but also in climate science and chemical engineering. Unsupervised machine learning will be used to find coherent structures in simulated flow in a pipe. Results will be used to develop a statistical theory of the transition to turbulence. For more details, see the recent article: Allawala, A., Tobias, S. M., & Marston, J. B. (2020). Dimensional reduction of direct statistical simulation. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 898, 533–18. http://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2020.382.

## Duration

Total project length: 175 hours.

## Task ideas
  * Apply dimensionality reduction techniques to a dataset of fluid simulations, such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), principal component analysis (PCA), or autoencoder neural networks. Determine the most important structures in predicting the onset of turbulence. 
  
## Expected results
  * Comparison between different dimensionality reduction techniques, with investigation of the numerical and physical validity of each. 

## Test
