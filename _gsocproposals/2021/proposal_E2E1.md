## Description

One of the important aspects of searches for new physics at the [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) involves the identification and reconstruction of single particles, jets and event topologies of interest in collision events. The End-to-End Deep Learning (E2E) project in the CMS experiment focuses on the development  of these reconstruction and identification tasks with innovative deep learning approaches.   

This project will focus on the integration of E2E code with the [CMSSW](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw) inference engine for use in reconstruction algorithms in offline and high-level trigger systems of the [CMS](https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms) experiment.



## Task ideas
 * Integration/interface of E2E with the CMSSW inference engine
 * Test and benchmarking of inference on GPUs

## Expected results
 * Integrated code within CMSSW classes
 * Benchmark of end-to-end deep learning inference on cpu and gpu


## Requirements
C++, Python, PyTorch and some previous experience in Machine Learning.
