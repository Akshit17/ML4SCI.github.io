## Description

The goal of the project is to build a predictive machine learning model for the planetary albedo based on existing data from planetary missions

## Task ideas
  * Implement a deep multi-objective regression model to predict the chemical composition of Mercury based on data collected by the Messenger mission.

## Expected results
  * Accurate models of albedo and chemical composition based on Messenger mission data
   
## Requirements 
Python, previous experience in Machine Learning.
