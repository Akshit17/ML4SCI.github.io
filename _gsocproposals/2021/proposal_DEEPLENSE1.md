## Description

Strong gravitational lensing is a promising probe of the substructure of dark matter to better understand its underlying nature. Deep learning methods have the potential to accurately identify images containing substructure, and differentiate [WIMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakly_interacting_massive_particles) particle dark matter from other well motivated models, including vortex substructure of dark matter condensates and superfluids.

This project will focus on further development of the DeepLense pipeline that combines state-of-the art of deep learning models with strong lensing simulations initially based on [PyAutoLens](https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoLens) for strong gravitational lens modeling. The focus of this project is on domain adaptation to account for the differences in the modeling and available real observational data

## Task ideas
 * Expand the DeepLense functionality with domain adaptation models suitable for computer vision tasks * Optimize and improve the interface to PyAutoLens

## Expected results
 *  Evaluate domain adaptation models to find the optimal model for the DeepLense modeling suite 

## Requirements
Python, PyTorch and relevant experience in Machine Learning.
