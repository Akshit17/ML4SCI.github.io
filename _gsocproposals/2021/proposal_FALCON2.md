## Description
[Falcon](http://inspirehep.net/record/1456803) is an ultra-fast non-parametric detector simulation package that automatically abstracts detector response, usually done by hand in fast-simulators used by particle physics experiments. The goal of this project is to extend the current implementation of graph auto-encoders to improve end-to-end simulation of the detector deposits. 

## Task ideas and expected results
  * Extension of GAEs to the falcon training for simulation  


## Requirements
Strong machine learning skills, good knowledge of C++ and Python. Interest in Machine Learning algorithms and applications.
