## Description
[DeepFalcon](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2020/files/NeurIPS_ML4PS_2020_138.pdf) is an ultra-fast non-parametric detector simulation package that automatically abstracts detector response, usually done by hand in fast-simulators used by particle physics experiments. The goal of this project is to extend the falcon training and inference capability to include diffusion networks to improve end-to-end simulation of the detector deposits. 

## Task ideas and expected results
  * Implementation of diffusion networks into the falcon training and inference

## Duration
175 hrs

## Test

)
## Requirements
Strong machine learning skills, good knowledge of C++ and Python. Interest in Machine Learning algorithms and applications.
