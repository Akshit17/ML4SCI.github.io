## Description

The history of a galaxy is encapsulated in the history of its gas cycling between the visible body of the
galaxy and its harder-to-detect diffuse circumgalactic medium (CGM).  We are researching methods to study the history of the CGM by developing computational and machine learning tools to use quasar absorption lines to determine the gas  composition, temperature and density.

The project focuses on applying ML dimensionality reduction techniques for the dataset of simulated quasar absorption spectra.

## Duration

Total project length: 175 hours.

## Task ideas
  * Implement machine learning-based dimensionality reduction models applicable to the quasar absorption spectra datasets


## Expected results
  * Reduced dimensional results that will still maintain a high level of accuracy compared to the original dataset
   
## Requirements 
Python, previous experience in Machine Learning. 

## Test

Please use this link to access the test for this project. Tests will be published in March.
