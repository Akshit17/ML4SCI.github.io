## Description

The field of Computer Vision has for years been dominated by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which use filters and create feature used by a multi-layer 
perceptron to perform the desired classification. But recently this field has been incredibly revolutionized by the architecture of Vision Transformers (ViT), 
which through the mechanism of self-attention has proven to obtain excellent results on many tasks.

## Task ideas
 * Develop a transformer based algorithm for classification of high energy particles.
 * Test and benchmarking on GPUs

## Expected results
 * Achieve competetive results using transformers (e.g. Vision Transformers) 
 * Benchmark of the transformer performance on cpu and gpu


## Requirements
C++, Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow and some previous experience in Machine Learning.
