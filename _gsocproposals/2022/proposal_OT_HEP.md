## Description
Assuming particle jets to be considered as probability distributions, the concept of Optimal Transport (OT) could be very useful in quantifying a distance metric between such distributions. 

## Task ideas and expected results
  * Combining OT concepts with deep learning techniques for applications such as Graph Compairsion, Anomaly Detection and other HEP applications.


## Requirements
Strong machine learning skills, good knowledge of C++ and Python. Interest in Machine Learning algorithms and applications.
