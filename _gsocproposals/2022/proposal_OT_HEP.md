## Description
The concept of Optimal Transport (OT) can be very useful in quantifying a distance metric between probability distributions. This project will focus on applying optimal transport methods to classification, anomaly detection and generative modeling tasks in particle physics.

## Task ideas and expected results
Application of optimal transport techniques using deep learning for classification, anomaly detection and graph generative models in high energy physics.

## Duration
175 hrs

## Test 
To be announced

## Requirements
Strong machine learning skills, good knowledge of C++ and Python. Interest in Machine Learning algorithms and applications.
